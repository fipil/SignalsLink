Otherwise it sends signal 0. <br> <strong>Doors, gates, trapdoors</strong> - For doors and gates, you need to monitor the ground-level block on the hinge side. If the block is open, the Output signal is 1; if it is closed, the Output signal is 0. <br> <strong>Chest or generally a container or any blocks that have inventory slots</strong> (e.g. firepit, barrel, trough, etc.). The Output signal depends on the input signal. <br> The input signal determines which slot is to be scanned. <br> Signal 1-14 specifies slots 0-13.

  "signalslink:block-handbooktext-managedchute": "The managed chute enables automated transport of items between different blocks. It transports items only in one direction, which is marked on the chute by a white arrow.<br> Unlike a slide, the managed chute has no inventory of its own and transports items directly from the block on the source side to the block on the target side. This means items are not stored in the chute, but are only transferred through it.<br> The managed chute has three Signals connectors: <strong>Input</strong>, <strong>Source</strong> and <strong>Target</strong>.<br> • <strong>Input</strong> is used to control transport. If the Input signal is 0, the chute is inactive and transports no items. A non-zero value on the input triggers transport of items from source to target. The following input values are supported:<br> 1 - Transport one item<br> 2 - Transport 2 items<br> 3 - Transport 4 items<br> 4 - Transport 8 items<br> 5 - Transport 16 items<br> 6 - Transport 32 items<br> 7 - Transport 64 items<br> 15 - Transport continuously.<br> Input values 1-7 allow transporting items in batches. If there are not enough items in the source block to transport the requested amount, the chute transports as many as it can and delivers the remainder when another input appears. If you want to transport a different amount, you can send different signal values to the input in sequence in the range 1 to 7, thus composing the desired batch size.<br> Input value 15 causes the chute to transport items from source to target continuously, regardless of how many items need to be transported. The chute will continue transporting items as soon as they appear in the source, until the input signal is changed to a different value.<br> Transport takes place if there is something available to transport on the source side and at the same time there is space on the target side to store the items. If one of these conditions is not met, the chute will attempt to transport items, but if it is not possible, it remains inactive until the situation changes (e.g. items appear in the source or space is freed in the target).<br> • <strong>Source</strong> is relevant if the input block is a block with an inventory. In that case, the signal on Source determines from which slot items should be taken. Signal 1-14 specifies slots 0-13. Signal 15 means items should be taken from the last slot.<br> Signal 0 means items should be taken from any slot. In this case, the chute searches all slots and takes items from the first slot that is not empty. If the source block has no inventory, this input is ignored.<br> • <strong>Target</strong> is relevant if the output block is a block with an inventory or air. For an inventory, the signal on Target determines into which slot items should be stored. Signal 1-15 specifies slots 0-14.<br> If the target block is air and there is ground below it, these target values are relevant: 1 - the chute will try to place a block from the source on the ground, 2 - the chute will try to place an item on the ground if it is placeable. This currently only works with coal and is useful e.g. for automatic stoking under a steel furnace.<br><br> If the source block is air, the chute will collect floating items from a 3x3 block area, where the middle block of this cube is the block in front of the chute mouth.<br><br> In addition to the above, the managed chute can also insert items of type Ingot, Iron bloom, and Blister steel into an anvil if the anvil is placed on the target side of the chute. If it inserts ingots onto the anvil, the plate forging recipe is selected automatically. In the case of Iron bloom and Blister steel, slag striking is selected so that they become ingots. This is very useful for automating forging with an automatic hammer. Before inserting onto the anvil, however, you must ensure that the inserted items are heated to the temperature required for forging. <br><br> <font size=\"20\" color=\"6082B6\">Transport filtering</font><br> The managed chute allows you to set conditions for filtering which items should be transported. Conditions are set using <strong>conditions on paper</strong>, whose use is explained <a href=\"handbook://signalslink:usageinfo-paperconditions\">on this page</a><br> ",
  "signalslink:block-handbooktext-managedwallchute": "A managed chute embedded in a wall enables automated transport of items between different blocks.

Its variant, the <a href=\"handbook://block-signalslink:managedwallchute-rock-granite-north-north\">Managed chute built into a wall</a>, then allows transporting items through walls, which can be very useful for hidden transport systems or for transporting items from a cellar or into a cellar without disturbing the cool cellar environment, which is important for long-term food preservation.

  "signalslink:usageinfo-paperconditions-text": "Some blocks from the <a href=\"handbook://signalslink:usageinfo-signalslink\">SignalsLink</a> mod allow using <strong>conditions on paper</strong>: <br> • <a href=\"handbook://block-signalslink:blocksensor-off-fwd-north-down\">Block sensor</a> <br> • <a href=\"handbook://block-signalslink:managedchute-north-down\">Managed chute</a> <br> • <a href=\"handbook://block-signalslink:managedwallchute-rock-granite-north-north\">Managed chute built into a wall</a> <br> <font size=\"20\" color=\"6082B6\">Conditions on paper</font><br> <strong>Conditions on paper</strong> are conditions written on <a href=\"handbook://item-paper-parchment\">parchment</a>. These conditions can be used to influence a block's behavior, for example to control output signals or to filter items in chutes. <br> Conditions are written into blocks (paragraphs). Each block consists of one or more lines, where each line contains one condition. All conditions <strong>in one block</strong> are evaluated such that the logical AND operator is applied between them and the result yields the resulting value of the whole block. <br> Individual blocks are separated by an empty line. The resulting values of the individual blocks then have the logical OR operator applied. Evaluation of conditions within a block proceeds from top to bottom in the order they are listed on the paper. Evaluation of blocks also proceeds in the order in which the blocks are listed on the paper. This means that as soon as a block evaluates to true, this result is returned to the calling block and processing does not continue with the next block. This is very important and must be taken into account. <br> <br> We distinguish several types of conditions: <br> <strong>game:plank-oak</strong> - Evaluates whether the monitored item in an inventory or the monitored block is of the specified type, i.e. its code matches exactly the specified code. If yes, the condition returns true.<br> <strong>game:plank-*</strong> - Evaluates whether the monitored item or block is of the specified type in any of its variants (marked with an asterisk). If yes, the condition returns true.<br> <strong>@.*-plank-.*</strong> - The code of the monitored item or block is evaluated using this regular expression. If it matches, the condition returns true.<br> <strong>attribute &gt; 1</strong> - Evaluates the value of an item attribute in an inventory or of the monitored block. Various comparison operators (greater/less/equal) can be used here. After evaluation, the comparison result (true/false) is returned.<br> <strong>attribute</strong> - If only the attribute name of the item is given in the condition, it is evaluated whether it has a value or not. That is, zero, NULL, an empty string, or false evaluates as false. A non-zero value, a string, or true evaluates as true.<br> <br> The negation operator <strong>!</strong> can be applied to all conditions. For example, <strong>!game:plank-oak</strong> evaluates as true if the monitored item or block is not exactly oak planks. <br> At the end of each block, you can add an instruction to set the output signal, for example <strong>output 1</strong>, which specifies that if this block evaluates to true, signal 1 will be sent to the output. This only matters for the <a href=\"handbook://block-signalslink:blocksensor-off-fwd-north-down\">Block sensor</a>, which allows you to set which signal will be sent to the output if a block or item matches the conditions listed in the block. For the other blocks that allow using conditions on paper, this instruction is ignored. <font size=\"20\" color=\"6082B6\">Setting up conditions</font><br> Write the conditions on <a href=\"handbook://item-paper-parchment\">parchment</a>. Do not sign the parchment so you can edit the text again.<br> Transfer the conditions into a block that supports it by right-clicking the target block with this parchment. The conditions will be saved into the block and you will see them in the info window when you look at the block. <br> To remove conditions from a block, take a blank parchment in your hand, crouch (shift key), and right-click the given block with this blank parchment. This will erase the conditions from the block.<br> If you want to copy conditions from a block onto a blank parchment, right-click the given block with the blank parchment without crouching.<br> And finally, a helper for finding out what code a block or item has and what attributes you have available for use in conditional expressions:<br> Take the item you are interested in into your hand, hold the ctrl key, and right-click this block on a block that supports conditions on paper. The item's code and its attributes available for conditions on paper will be stored in that block. You can now copy them to a blank parchment as described above, and here you can freely edit them into condition blocks and use them to configure the block. ",
