Its variant, the <a href=\"handbook://block-signalslink:managedwallchute-rock-granite-north-north\">Managed Chute built into a wall</a>, then allows transporting items through walls, which can be very useful for hidden transport systems    or for moving items from a cellar or into a cellar without disturbing the cool cellar environment, important for long-term food preservation.",
  "signalslink:usageinfo-paperconditions-text": "    Some blocks from the <a href=\"handbook://signalslink:usageinfo-signalslink\">SignalsLink</a> mod allow using <strong>conditions on paper</strong>:    <br>    • <a href=\"handbook://block-signalslink:blocksensor-off-fwd-north-down\">Block Sensor</a>    <br>    • <a href=\"handbook://block-signalslink:managedchute-north-down\">Managed Chute</a>    <br>    • <a href=\"handbook://block-signalslink:managedwallchute-rock-granite-north-north\">Managed Chute built into a wall</a>    <br>    <font size=\"20\" color=\"6082B6\">Conditions on paper</font>    <strong>conditions on paper</strong> are conditions written on <a href=\"handbook://item-paper-parchment\">parchment</a>. These conditions can be used to influence a block’s behavior, for example to control output signals or to filter items in chutes.    <br>    Conditions are written into blocks (paragraphs). Each block consists of one or more lines, with one condition on each line. All conditions <strong>within one block</strong> are evaluated by applying the logical AND operator between them, and the result gives the final value of the whole block.    <br>    Individual blocks are separated by an empty line. The resulting values of the individual blocks then have the logical OR operator applied. Evaluation of individual conditions in a block proceeds from top to bottom, as the conditions are written on the paper.    Evaluation of blocks also proceeds in the order in which the blocks are written on the paper. This means that as soon as a block evaluates to true, this result is returned to the calling block and no further blocks are processed.    This is very important and must be taken into account.    <br>    <br>    We distinguish several types of conditions:    <br>    <strong>game:plank-oak</strong> - Evaluates whether the monitored item in the inventory or the monitored block is of the specified type, i.e., its code matches exactly the given code. If yes, the condition returns true.<br>    <strong>game:plank-*</strong> - Evaluates whether the monitored item or block is of the specified type in any of its variants (marked with an asterisk). If yes, the condition returns true.<br>    <strong>@.*-plank-.*</strong> - The code of the monitored item or block is evaluated using this regular expression. If there is a match, the condition returns true.<br>    <strong>attribute > 1</strong> - Evaluates the value of an item attribute in the inventory or of the monitored block. Various comparison operators can be used (greater/less/equal). After evaluation, the result of the comparison is returned (true/false).<br>    <strong>attribute</strong> - If only the attribute name is specified in the condition, it evaluates whether it has a value or not. That is, zero, NULL, an empty string, or false evaluates as false. A non-zero value, a string, or true evaluates as true.<br>    <br>    The negation operator <strong>!</strong> can be applied to all conditions. For example, !game:plank-oak evaluates as true if the monitored item or block is not exactly oak planks.    <br>    At the end of each block you can add an instruction to set the output signal, for example <strong>output 1</strong>, which specifies that if this block evaluates to true, signal 1 will be sent to the output.    This only matters for the <a href=\"handbook://block-signalslink:blocksensor-off-fwd-north-down\">Block Sensor</a>, which allows you to set what signal will be sent to the output if a block or item matches the conditions specified in the block. For other blocks that allow using conditions on paper, this instruction is ignored.    <font size=\"20\" color=\"6082B6\">Setting up conditions</font>    Write the conditions on <a href=\"handbook://item-paper-parchment\">parchment</a>. Do not sign the parchment so you can edit the text again.<br>    Transfer the conditions into a block that supports it by right-clicking the given block with this parchment. The conditions will be saved into the block and you will see them in the info window when you look at the block. <br>    To remove conditions from a block, take an empty parchment in hand, crouch (shift key), and right-click the given block with this empty parchment. This deletes the conditions from the block.<br>    If you want to copy conditions from a block onto an empty parchment, right-click the given block with an empty parchment without crouching.<br>    And finally, a helper to find out what code a given block or item has and what attributes you have available for use in conditional expressions:<br>    Take the item you are interested in into your hand, hold the ctrl key, and right-click this block onto a block that supports conditions on paper. The item’s code and its attributes available for conditions on paper will be saved into that block. You can now copy them onto     an empty parchment as described above, and here you can edit them freely into condition blocks and use them to configure the block.",
