  "signalslink:block-handbooktext-blocksensor": "    The block sensor detects the presence of a block at the selected adjacent position and, based on its type and/or the input signal, provides output information about its state or slot fill level.    <br>    <font size=\"20\" color=\"6082B6\">Currently supported blocks are:</font>    <br>    <strong>Anvil</strong> - if there is an ingot hot enough for forging on the anvil, the output signal is 1. Otherwise it sends signal 0.    <br>    <strong>Doors, gates, hatches</strong> - For doors and gates, you need to monitor the ground block on the hinge side. If the block is open, the output signal is 1; if it is closed, the output signal is 0.    <br>    <strong>Chest or generally a container or any blocks that have inventory slots</strong> (e.g., firepit, barrel, trough, etc.). The output is a signal according to the input signal.    <br>    The input signal determines which slot should be scanned.    <br>    Signal 1-14 specifies slots 0-13. The output is the slot fill level relative to the maximum stack capacity of the item in that slot, converted to a 0-15 signal.    <br>    Signal 15 specifies that the sensor should detect the total fill of all slots, e.g., an entire chest.    <br>    <strong>Some other block not listed above</strong> - If there is nothing in the monitored space (air), the output signal is 0. If there is water, the output is 2 - fresh or 3 - salt water. If there is any other block, the output signal is 1.    <br>",
  "signalslink:block-handbooktext-entitysensor": "    The entity sensor detects the presence of entities (players, animals, wild animals, or monsters) in the marked area and can provide information on the outputs about their count, type, or state. The sensor requires charging for operation    with one or more Temporal gears. The consumption rate depends on the size of the monitored area.    <br>    <strong>Inputs x, y, z</strong> determine the size of the monitored area in blocks.    <br>    On the <strong>Error</strong> output the signal is 1 if the sensor is discharged, otherwise 0.    <br>    The <strong>Output 1 settings</strong> and <strong>Output 2 settings</strong> inputs determine what information will be provided on outputs 1 and 2. This way, each output can provide different information based on these input settings.    <br>    Options are:    <br>    1 - Output returns <strong>Count</strong>. Number of detected entities.    <br>    2 - Output returns <strong>Category</strong>. Bit flags of entity category 0–3: player, creature, animal, wild animal.    <br>    3 - Output returns <strong>Life state</strong>. All detected entities are: 1–dead, 2–alive, or 15–mixed.    <br>    4 - Output returns <strong>Sex</strong>. All detected entities are: 1–male, 2–female, or 15–mixed.    <br>    5 - Output returns <strong>Age</strong>. All detected entities are: 1–young, 2–adult, or 15–mixed.    <br>    6 - Output returns <strong>Species</strong>. All detected entities are: 1–player, 2–animal, 3–wild animal, 4–creature, or 15–mixed.    <br>    7 - Output returns <strong>Reproductive state</strong>. All detected entities are: 1–ready to mate, 2–pregnant, 3–nursing, or 15–mixed.    <br>    8 - Output returns <strong>Reproductive state flags</strong>. Bit flags 0–2: ready to mate, pregnant, nursing.    <br>    9 - Output returns <strong>Minimum generation</strong>. The minimum detected generation is: 0–15. Present entities without a specified generation are ignored.    <br>    10 - Output returns <strong>Maximum generation</strong>. The maximum detected generation is: 0–15. Present entities without a specified generation are ignored.    <br>    11 - Output returns <strong>Minimum weight</strong>. The minimum detected weight is: 1–starving, 2–low, 3–decent, 4–good. Present entities without a specified weight (not animals) are ignored.    <br>    12 - Output returns <strong>Maximum weight</strong>. The maximum detected weight is: 1–starving, 2–low, 3–decent, 4–good. Present entities without a specified weight (not animals) are ignored.    <br>",

It can transport items between blocks similarly to a chute, but you control it with signals and it gives you    much greater control over what is being transported. Its variant, the <a href=\"handbook://block-signalslink:managedwallchute\">wall-embedded Managed Chute</a>, allows transporting items through walls, which can be very useful for hidden transport systems    or for transporting items from a cellar or into a cellar without disrupting the cool cellar environment, important for long-term food preservation.
