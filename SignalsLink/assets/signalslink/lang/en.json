Otherwise it sends signal 0.<br><strong>Doors, gates, trapdoors</strong> - For doors and gates you need to monitor the ground-level block on the hinge side. If the block is open, the output is signal 1; if it is closed, the output is signal 0.<br><strong>Chest or, in general, a container or any blocks that have inventory slots</strong> (e.g. firepit, barrel, trough, etc.). The output signal depends on the input signal.<br>The input signal determines which slot should be scanned.<br>Signal 1-14 selects slots 0-13. The output is the slot fill level relative to the maximum stack capacity of the item in that slot, converted to a 0-15 signal.<br>Signal 15 means the sensor should detect the total fill level of all slots, e.g. an entire chest.<br><strong>Some other block not listed above</strong> - If there is nothing in the monitored space (air), the output is signal 0. If there is water, the output is 2 for fresh water or 3 for salt water. If there is any other block, the output is signal 1.<br><br><font size=\"21\"><strong>Entity sensor</strong></font><br>Detects the presence of entities (players, animals, wild animals, or monsters) in a marked area and can provide information on its outputs about their count, type, or state. The sensor requires a charge to operate using one or more temporal gears (Temporal gears). The consumption rate then depends on the size of the monitored area.<br><strong>Inputs x, y, z</strong> determine the size of the monitored area in blocks.<br>On the <strong>Error</strong> output there is signal 1 if the sensor is discharged, otherwise 0.<br>The <strong>Output 1 configuration</strong> and <strong>Output 2 configuration</strong> inputs determine what information will be provided on outputs 1 and 2. You can get different information on each output depending on these input settings.<br>Options are:<br>1 - Output returns <strong>Count</strong>. The number of detected entities.<br>2 - Output returns <strong>Category</strong>. Bit flags of entity category 0–3: player, creature, animal, wild animal.<br>3 - Output returns <strong>Life state</strong>. All detected entities are: 1–dead, 2–alive, or 15–mixed.<br>4 - Output returns <strong>Sex</strong>. All detected entities are: 1–male, 2–female, or 15–mixed.<br>5 - Output returns <strong>Age</strong>. All detected entities are: 1–young, 2–adult, or 15–mixed.<br>6 - Output returns <strong>Species</strong>. All detected entities are: 1–player, 2–animal, 3–wild animal, 4–creature, or 15–mixed.<br>7 - Output returns <strong>Reproductive state</strong>. All detected entities are: 1–ready to mate, 2–pregnant, 3–nursing, or 15–mixed.<br>8 - Output returns <strong>Reproductive state flags</strong>. Bit flags 0–2: ready to mate, pregnant, nursing.<br>9 - Output returns <strong>Minimum generation</strong>. The minimum detected generation is: 0–15. Present entities without a specified generation are ignored.<br>10 - Output returns <strong>Maximum generation</strong>. The maximum detected generation is: 0–15. Present entities without a specified generation are ignored.<br>11 - Output returns <strong>Minimum weight</strong>. The minimum detected weight is: 1–starving, 2–low, 3–decent, 4–good. Present entities without specified weight (not animals) are ignored.<br>12 - Output returns <strong>Maximum weight</strong>. The maximum detected weight is: 1–starving, 2–low, 3–decent, 4–good. Present entities without specified weight (not animals) are ignored.<br><br><font size=\"20\" color=\"6082B6\">We have an AI hour</font><br>We demonstrate how automated translation of mod texts works using AI, etc.<br>"
