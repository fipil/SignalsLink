Otherwise it sends signal 0.<br><strong>Doors, gates, trapdoors</strong> - For doors and gates you need to watch the ground-level block on the hinge side. If the block is open, the Output signal is 1; if it is closed, the Output signal is 0.<br><strong>Chest or generally a container or any blocks that have inventory slots</strong> (e.g. firepit, barrel, trough, etc.). The Output signal depends on the input signal.<br>The input signal determines which slot should be scanned.<br>Signal 1-14 selects slots 0-13. The output is information about how full the slot is relative to the maximum stack capacity of the item in that slot, converted to a 0-15 signal.<br>Signal 15 tells the sensor to detect the total fill level of all slots, e.g. of an entire chest.<br><strong>Some other block not listed above</strong> - If there is nothing in the monitored space (air), the Output signal is 0. If there is water, the output is 2-fresh or 3-salt water. If there is any other block, the Output signal is 1.<br><br><font size=\"21\"><strong>Entity Sensor</strong></font><br>Detects the presence of entities (players, animals, wild animals, or monsters) in the marked area and can provide information on the outputs about their count, type, or state. The sensor requires charging for operation using one or more temporal gears. The consumption rate depends on the size of the monitored area.<br><strong>Inputs x, y, z</strong> determine the size of the monitored area in blocks.<br>On the <strong>Error</strong> output, the signal is 1 if the sensor is discharged, otherwise 0.<br>The <strong>Output 1 config</strong> and <strong>Output 2 config</strong> inputs determine what information will be provided on outputs 1 and 2. You can get different information on each output based on these input settings.<br>Options are:<br>1 - Output returns <strong>Count</strong>. Number of detected entities.<br>2 - Output returns <strong>Category</strong>. Bit flags of entity category 0–3: player, creature, animal, wild animal.<br>3 - Output returns <strong>Life state</strong>. All detected entities are: 1–dead, 2–alive, or 15–mixed.<br>4 - Output returns <strong>Sex</strong>. All detected entities are: 1–male, 2–female, or 15–mixed.<br>5 - Output returns <strong>Age</strong>. All detected entities are: 1–young, 2–adult, or 15–mixed.<br>6 - Output returns <strong>Species</strong>. All detected entities are: 1–player, 2–animal, 3–wild animal, 4–creature, or 15–mixed.<br>7 - Output returns <strong>Reproductive state</strong>. All detected entities are: 1–ready to mate, 2–pregnant, 3–lactating, or 15–mixed.<br>8 - Output returns <strong>Reproductive state flags</strong>. Bit flags 0–2: ready to mate, pregnant, lactating.<br>9 - Output returns <strong>Minimum generation</strong>. Minimum detected generation is: 0–15. Present entities without a specified generation are ignored.<br>10 - Output returns <strong>Maximum generation</strong>. Maximum detected generation is: 0–15. Present entities without a specified generation are ignored.<br>11 - Output returns <strong>Minimum weight</strong>. Minimum detected weight is: 1–starving, 2–low, 3–decent, 4–good. Present entities without a specified weight (not animals) are ignored.<br>12 - Output returns <strong>Maximum weight</strong>. Maximum detected weight is: 1–starving, 2–low, 3–decent, 4–good. Present entities without a specified weight (not animals) are ignored.<br><br><font size=\"21\"><strong>Localization test</strong></font><br>Makes it possible to present localization using AI, etc. I'm showing colleagues here how translation using AI works.<br>"
