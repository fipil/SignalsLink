  "signalslink:usageinfo-paperconditions-text": "Some blocks from the <a href=\"handbook://signalslink:usageinfo-signalslink\">SignalsLink</a> mod allow using <strong>paper conditions</strong>:<br>• <a href=\"handbook://block-signalslink:blocksensor-off-fwd-north-down\">Block sensor</a><br>• <a href=\"handbook://block-signalslink:managedchute-north-down\">Managed chute</a><br>• <a href=\"handbook://block-signalslink:managedwallchute-rock-granite-north-north\">Managed chute built into a wall</a><br><font size=\"20\" color=\"6082B6\">Paper conditions</font><strong>paper conditions</strong> are conditions written on <a href=\"handbook://item-paper-parchment\">parchment</a>. These conditions can be used to influence a block’s behavior, for example to control output signals or to filter items in chutes.<br>Conditions are written into blocks (paragraphs). Each block consists of one or more lines, where each line contains one condition. All conditions <strong>within one block</strong> are evaluated by applying the logical AND operator between them, and the result yields the resulting value of the whole block.<br>Individual blocks are separated by an empty line. The resulting values of the individual blocks then have the logical OR operator applied. Evaluation of individual conditions within a block proceeds from top to bottom as they are listed on the paper. Evaluation of blocks also proceeds in the order in which the blocks are listed on the paper. This means that as soon as a block evaluates to true, this result is returned to the calling block and no further blocks are processed. This is very important and must be taken into account.<br><br>We distinguish several types of conditions:<br><strong>game:plank-oak</strong> - Evaluates whether the tracked item in the inventory or the tracked block is of the specified type, i.e. its code matches exactly the specified code. If yes, the condition returns true.<br><strong>game:plank-*</strong> - Evaluates whether the tracked item or block is of the specified type in any of its variants (marked with an asterisk). If yes, the condition returns true.<br><strong>@.*-plank-.*</strong> - The code of the tracked item or block is evaluated using this regular expression. If it matches, the condition returns true.<br><strong>attribute > 1</strong> - Evaluates the value of an attribute of the item in the inventory or the tracked block. Various comparison operators (greater/less/equal) can be used. After evaluation, the comparison result (true/false) is returned.<br><strong>attribute</strong> - If only the attribute name is given in the condition, it evaluates whether it has a value or not. That is, zero, NULL, an empty string, or false evaluates as false. A non-zero value, a string, or true evaluates as true.<br><br>The negation operator <strong>!</strong> can be applied to all conditions. For example, !game:plank-oak evaluates as true if the tracked item or block is not exactly oak planks.<br>At the end of each block you can add an instruction to set the output signal, for example <strong>output 1</strong>, which specifies that if this block evaluates to true, signal 1 will be sent to the output. This is only meaningful for the <a href=\"handbook://block-signalslink:blocksensor-off-fwd-north-down\">Block sensor</a>, which allows you to set what signal will be sent to the output if a block or item matches the conditions listed in the block. For the other blocks that allow using paper conditions, this instruction is ignored.<font size=\"20\" color=\"6082B6\">Setting up conditions</font>Write the conditions on <a href=\"handbook://item-paper-parchment\">parchment</a>. Do not sign the parchment so that you can edit the text again.<br>Transfer the conditions into a block that supports it by right-clicking that block with this parchment. The conditions will be saved into the block and you will see them in the info window when you look at the block. <br>To remove conditions from a block, hold a blank parchment, crouch (shift key), and right-click the block with the blank parchment. This deletes the conditions from the block.<br>If you want to copy conditions from a block onto a blank parchment, right-click the block with a blank parchment without crouching.<br>And finally, a tip for finding out what code a block or item has and what attributes you have available for use in conditional expressions:<br>Hold the item you are interested in, hold the ctrl key, and right-click this item on a block that supports paper conditions. The item code and its attributes available for paper conditions will be saved into that block. You can now copy them onto a blank parchment as described above, and here you can freely edit them into condition blocks and use them to configure the block.",
