  "signalslink:usageinfo-paperconditions-text": "Some blocks from the <a href=\"handbook://signalslink:usageinfo-signalslink\">SignalsLink</a> mod allow using <strong>paper conditions</strong>:<br>• <a href=\"handbook://block-signalslink:blocksensor-off-fwd-north-down\">Block Sensor</a><br>• <a href=\"handbook://block-signalslink:managedchute-north-down\">Managed Chute</a><br>• <a href=\"handbook://block-signalslink:managedwallchute-rock-granite-north-north\">Managed Chute Built into a Wall</a><br><font size=\"20\" color=\"6082B6\">Paper conditions</font><strong>paper conditions</strong> are conditions written on <a href=\"handbook://item-paper-parchment\">parchment</a>. These conditions can be used to influence a block's behavior, for example to control output signals or to filter items in chutes.<br>Conditions are written into blocks (paragraphs). Each block consists of one or more lines, where each line contains one condition. All conditions <strong>in one block</strong> are evaluated by applying the logical AND operator between them, and the result yields the final value of the whole block.<br>Individual blocks are separated by an empty line. The logical OR operator is then applied to the resulting values of the individual blocks. Evaluation of individual conditions within a block proceeds from top to bottom, as the conditions are written on the paper. Evaluation of blocks also proceeds in the order in which the blocks are written on the paper. This means that as soon as a block evaluates to true, this result is returned to the calling block and evaluation does not continue with the next block. This is very important and you must take it into account.<br><br>We distinguish several types of conditions:<br><strong>game:plank-oak</strong> - Evaluates whether the observed item in the inventory or the observed block is of the specified type, i.e., its code matches exactly the specified code. If yes, the condition returns true.<br><strong>game:plank-*</strong> - Evaluates whether the observed item or block is of the specified type in any of its variants (denoted by the asterisk). If yes, the condition returns true.<br><strong>@.*-plank-.*</strong> - The code of the observed item or block is evaluated using this regular expression. If it matches, the condition returns true.<br><strong>attribute &gt; 1</strong> - Evaluates the value of an item attribute in the inventory or of the observed block. Various comparison operators can be used here (greater/less/equal). After evaluation, the result of the comparison is returned (true/false).<br><strong>attribute</strong> - If only the name of an item attribute is given in the condition, it evaluates whether it has a value or not. That is, zero, NULL, an empty string, or false evaluates as false. A non-zero value, a string, or true evaluates as true.<br><br>The negation operator <strong>!</strong> can be applied to all conditions. For example, !game:plank-oak evaluates to true if the observed item or block is not exactly oak planks.<br>At the end of each block, you can add an instruction to set the output signal, for example <strong>output 1</strong>, which specifies that if this block evaluates to true, signal 1 will be sent to the output. This only matters for the <a href=\"handbook://block-signalslink:blocksensor-off-fwd-north-down\">Block Sensor</a> block, which allows you to set which signal will be sent to the output if a block or item matches the conditions listed in the block. For other blocks that allow using paper conditions, this instruction is ignored.<font size=\"20\" color=\"6082B6\">Setting up conditions</font>Write the conditions on <a href=\"handbook://item-paper-parchment\">parchment</a>. Do not sign the parchment so you can edit the text again.<br>Transfer the conditions into a block that supports it by right-clicking the given block with this parchment. The conditions will be saved into the block and you will see them in the info window when you look at the block. <br>To remove the conditions from a block, take an empty parchment into your hand, sneak (shift key) and click the given block with this empty parchment. This will erase the conditions from the block.<br>If you want to copy the conditions from a block onto an empty parchment, right-click the given block with an empty parchment without sneaking.<br>And finally, a tip to find out what code a block or item has and what attributes you have available for use in conditional expressions:<br>Take the item you are interested in into your hand, hold the ctrl key and right-click a block that supports paper conditions with this block. The item's code and its attributes available for paper conditions will be saved into that block. You can now copy them onto a blank parchment as described above, and edit them as you like into condition blocks and use them to configure the block.",
