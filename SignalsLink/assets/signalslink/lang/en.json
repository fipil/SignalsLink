  "signalslink:block-handbooktext-entitysensor": "    The entity sensor detects the presence of entities (players, animals, wild animals, or monsters) in the marked area and can provide information on its outputs about their count, type, or state.

Its variant <a href=\"handbook://block-signalslink:managedwallchute-rock-granite-north-north\">Controlled Chute built into a wall<\\/a> then makes it possible to transport items through walls, which can be very useful for hidden transport systems    or for transporting items from a cellar or into a cellar without disturbing the cool cellar environment, important for long-term food preservation.",
  "signalslink:usageinfo-paperconditions-text": "    Some blocks from the <a href=\"handbook://signalslink:usageinfo-signalslink\">SignalsLink<\\/a> mod allow using <strong>conditions on paper<\\/strong>:    <br>    • <a href=\"handbook://block-signalslink:blocksensor-off-fwd-north-down\">Block Sensor<\\/a>    <br>    • <a href=\"handbook://block-signalslink:managedchute-north-down\">Controlled Chute<\\/a>    <br>    • <a href=\"handbook://block-signalslink:managedwallchute-rock-granite-north-north\">Controlled Chute built into a wall<\\/a>    <br>    <font size=\"20\" color=\"6082B6\">Conditions on paper<\\/font>    <strong>conditions on paper<\\/strong> are conditions written on <a href=\"handbook://item-paper-parchment\">parchment<\\/a>. These conditions can be used to influence a block's behavior, for example to control output signals or to filter items in chutes.    <br>    Conditions are written into blocks (paragraphs). Each block consists of one or more lines, where each line contains one condition. All conditions <strong>within one block<\\/strong> are evaluated by applying the logical operator AND between them, and the result gives the resulting value of the whole block.    <br>    Individual blocks are separated by an empty line. The logical operator OR is then applied to the resulting values of the individual blocks. The evaluation of individual conditions within a block proceeds from top to bottom, as the conditions are listed on the paper.    The evaluation of blocks also proceeds in the order in which the blocks are listed on the paper. This means that as soon as a block evaluates to true, this result is returned to the calling block and processing does not continue with further blocks.    This is very important and must be taken into account.    <br>    <br>    We distinguish several types of conditions:    <br>    <strong>game:plank-oak<\\/strong> - Evaluates whether the monitored item in an inventory or the monitored block is of the specified type, i.e., its code matches exactly the specified code. If so, the condition returns true.<br>    <strong>game:plank-*<\\/strong> - Evaluates whether the monitored item or block is of the specified type in any of its variants (marked with an asterisk). If so, the condition returns true.<br>    <strong>@.*-plank-.*<\\/strong> - The code of the monitored item or block is evaluated using this regular expression. If it matches, the condition returns true.<br>    <strong>attribute > 1<\\/strong> - Evaluates the value of an attribute of the item in the inventory or of the monitored block. Various comparison operators can be used here (greater/less/equal). After evaluation, the result of the comparison (true/false) is returned.<br>    <strong>attribute<\\/strong> - If only the name of an item attribute is given in the condition, it evaluates whether it has a value or not. That is, zero, NULL, an empty string, or false evaluates as false. A nonzero value, a string, or true evaluates as true.<br>    <br>    The negation operator <strong>!<\\/strong> can be applied to all conditions. For example, !game:plank-oak evaluates as true if the monitored item or block is not exactly oak planks.    <br>    At the end of each block, you can add an instruction to set the output signal, for example <strong>output 1<\\/strong>, which specifies that if this block evaluates to true, signal 1 will be sent to the output.    This is meaningful only for the <a href=\"handbook://block-signalslink:blocksensor-off-fwd-north-down\">Block Sensor<\\/a>, which allows setting what signal will be sent to the output if a block or item matches the conditions listed in the block. For other blocks that allow using conditions on paper, this instruction is ignored.    <font size=\"20\" color=\"6082B6\">Setting up conditions<\\/font>    Write the conditions on <a href=\"handbook://item-paper-parchment\">parchment<\\/a>. Do not sign the parchment so you can edit the text again.<br>    Transfer the conditions into a supporting block by right-clicking the given block with this parchment. The conditions will be saved into the block and you will see them in the info window when you look at the block. <br>    To remove conditions from a block, hold an empty parchment, crouch (shift key), and right-click the given block with the empty parchment. This will delete the conditions from the block.<br>    If you want to copy conditions from a block onto an empty parchment, right-click the given block with an empty parchment without crouching.<br>    And finally a helper for finding out a block's or item's code and what attributes you have available for use in condition expressions:<br>    Hold the item you are interested in, hold the ctrl key, and right-click this block on a block that supports conditions on paper. The item's code and its attributes available for conditions on paper will be saved into that block. You can now copy them onto     an empty parchment as described above, and edit them as desired into condition blocks and use them to configure the block.",
