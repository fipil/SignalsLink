The output is information about the slot’s fill level relative to the maximum stack capacity of the item in that slot, converted to a 0–15 signal.<br>Signal 15 indicates that the sensor should detect the block state based on what kind of block it is.<br>Currently supported blocks are:<br>Chest or any general container – the output signal corresponds to the total fullness of the container.<br>Any blocks that have inventory slots (e.g., firepit, barrel, etc.). The output is a signal according to the input signal; see the description above.<br>Anvil – if there is a sufficiently hot ingot on the anvil ready for forging, the Output is signal 1. Otherwise it sends signal 0.<br><br>"
