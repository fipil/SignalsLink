Allows turning the transmission of electrical current on or off.<br>If a signal is present at the input, the switch is on. If no signal is present at the input, the switch is off.<br><strong>EP Meter</strong><br>Provides information about the state of the electrical network the meter is connected to.<br>If signal 1 is present at the input, the output signal shows the battery charge state in the network. 0 - batteries are empty, 15 - batteries are fully charged.<br>If signal 2 is present at the input, the output signal shows the production/consumption balance of electricity. Values 1-7: more is consumed than produced, 8: consumption=production, 9-15: production exceeds consumption.<br>If signal 3 is present at the input, the output signal shows the current in the cables at the block the meter is attached to. Values 0-12 represent current from 0 up to the cable's maximum capacity. 13-15 represent cable overload (likely already smoldering and will soon burn out)<br>If another signal is present at the input, the output is signal 0."
