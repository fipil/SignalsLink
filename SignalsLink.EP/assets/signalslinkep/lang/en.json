Allows switching the transmission of electric current on or off.<br>If a signal is present at the input, the switch is on. If there is no signal at the input, the switch is off.<br><strong>EP meter</strong><br>Allows obtaining information about the state of the electrical network to which the meter is connected.<br>If signal 1 is present at the input, the output signal shows the battery charge level in the network.<br>If signal 2 is present at the input, the output signal shows the production/consumption balance of electricity. Values 1-7: consumption exceeds production, 8: consumption=production, 9-15: electricity production exceeds consumption.<br>If another signal is present at the input, the output is 0."
