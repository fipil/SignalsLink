Allows turning the flow of electrical current on or off.<br>If there is a signal on the input, the switch is on. If there is no signal on the input, the switch is off.<br><strong>EP meter</strong><br>Allows obtaining information about the state of the electrical network to which the meter is connected.<br>If the input signal is 1, the output signal shows the charge level of the batteries in the network.<br>If the input signal is 2, the output signal shows the production/consumption balance of electricity. Values 1-7: more is consumed than produced, 8: consumption=production, 9-15: production exceeds consumption.<br>If another signal is on the input, the output signal is 0."
